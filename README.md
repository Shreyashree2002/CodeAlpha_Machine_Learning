# Credit Scoring Prediction
A Credit Scoring Prediction Model is a machine learning model designed to evaluate the creditworthiness of individuals or businesses by predicting the likelihood that they will default on a loan .
## Key Components of a Credit Scoring Prediction Model:
### Input Features (Predictors): 
These are the variables that the model uses to make predictions. The features typically represent financial and demographic information about the individuals, such as:
Personal Information: Age, Client_id, etc.
Financial History: Income.
Loan Details: Amount requested.
### Target Variable:
The target variable is typically binary (e.g., 1 for default and 0 for non-default). It indicates whether a customer has defaulted on a loan .
## Steps to Build a Credit Scoring Prediction Model
### Data Collection:
Gather historical credit data, including both financial and behavioral data of individuals or businesses.
### Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing values: Replace or impute missing data.
Normalization: Scale numerical values (e.g., income, loan amount) to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
### Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and test sets.
Choose an appropriate algorithm (logistic regression, decision tree, SVM, etc.) to train on the historical data.
Train the model on the training set by feeding in the input features and target variable.
### Model Evaluation:
Accuracy: Measure how often the model correctly predicts defaults and non-defaults.
Confusion Matrix: Shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
Precision and Recall: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the ability to capture all actual defaults.
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall to give a single performance metric.
